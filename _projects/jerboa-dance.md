My wife, [Jaime Waliczek](http://jerboadance.com/company/JaimeWaliczek.html), is Artistic Director and Choreographer of [Jerboa Dance](http://jerboadance.com), a non-profit dance company that performs mostly in the Seattle area.  Over the years I've volunteered with the company in various roles such as costume design/construction, house management, producing, lighting design, and more. 

## Upcoming Shows
Nothing currently scheduled

## Costumes
I was primary costume designer and responsible for costume construction over the course of several Jerboa Dance seasons.  The costumes I'm most pleased with from this time are those for *continuum*.  For a full gallery of show images, head over to the *continuum* page on [JerboaDance.com](http://jerboadance.com/performances/continuum.html).
