### Personal
Based in Seattle, Nell Waliczek appreciates the beauty of the Pacific Northwest but isn't particularly interested in hiking, skiing, snowboarding, climbing or any of the other sporty activities that enthrall many Seattlites. You're much more likely to find her being jumped on by her children while preaching to them about the importance of power tool safety.  Well, either that or at the fabric store dreaming about projects she never seems to have time for.  Or, if she's really lucky, she can be found curled up reading a book.  Once upon a time, Nell used to be an active Salsa dancer.
