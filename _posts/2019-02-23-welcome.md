As with most blogs, this one contains a variety of content. Maybe you're here for my ramblings on technology or commentary on links I've found interesting. Or perhaps you're here for the step-by-step explanations of things I've built like beds, bookcases, or costumes!  Either way, I hope you enjoy! Though I suppose I'll never really know since commenting on posts is disabled because, well, ugh the internet.
